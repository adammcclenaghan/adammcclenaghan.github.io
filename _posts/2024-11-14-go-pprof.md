Lately I've been doing some memory optimisations for Go programs, and Go's pprof tool has been invaluable.

In this post, I'll talk a little bit about how you can use pprof to profile memory usage in your Go programs.

I'll also point out a small 'gotcha' to watch out for.

> Go's `pprof` tool is useful for more than just analysing heap profiles. You can read more about its capabilities [here](https://go.dev/blog/pprof)

> Go provides a few ways to look at the memory usage of your programs. In this post I'll discuss [pprof.WriteHeapProfile](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof#WriteHeapProfile) which is a nice way to get a snapshot at a specific point in the execution flow of your program. However, Go also has [http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof) which lets you investigate heap usage at a point in time via an HTTP endpoint.

## The Program

We need a small program to test. 

If you want to follow along, I've created a repository [here](https://github.com/adammcclenaghan/walk-with-go)

Overview of what this program does:
1. Walks the `demo-dir` directory which contains 1 million files.
2. Increases a counter for each file visited & logs progress 
3. Outputs a heap profile on the first and last files visited

The most relevant part of the program for us is the following section:

```go
	// Walk the demo directory.
	visitCounter := 0
	err = filepath.Walk(demoDir, func(path string, _ os.FileInfo, err error) error {
		if err != nil {
			// Stop walking if we get an error.
			return err
		}

		// Write heap profile on first visit
		if visitCounter == 0 {
			err := writeHeap(filepath.Join(outputDir, "first-visit.prof"))
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Error creating heap during first visit")
				log.Fatal(err)
			}
		}

		// Write heap profile on last visit
		if visitCounter == 1_000_000 {
			err := writeHeap(filepath.Join(outputDir, "last-visit.prof"))
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Error creating heap during last visit")
				log.Fatal(err)
			}
		}

		visitCounter++
		// Print to give an indication of progress
		if visitCounter%10_000 == 0 {
			fmt.Printf("Visited %d files \n", visitCounter)
		}

		return nil
	})
```

Go makes it nice and easy to write a heap profile at some point in our program to a file:
```go
func writeHeap(filename string) error {
	f, err := os.Create(filename)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()
	if err := pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f); err != nil {
		return err
	}
	
	return nil
}
```

This program outputs two heap profiles to disk:
- first-visit.prof
- last-visit.prof

## Profiling with pprof

Go comes with a native profiling tool named pprof, we can use it to investigate these heap profiles.

Lets start by looking at the memory profile taken during the first file visit:
```bash
21:56 $ go tool pprof first-visit.prof 
File: main
Type: inuse_space
Time: Nov 12, 2024 at 9:56pm (GMT)
Entering interactive mode (type "help" for commands, "o" for options)
```

`Type` defaults to `inuse_space`. There's a few values we can use:
- inuse_space: The amount of memory currently in use by live objects (allocated but not freed)
- inuse_objects: The number of live objects currently in use in memory.
- alloc_space: The total amount of memory allocated (including both live and dead objects).
- alloc_objects: The total number of objects that have been allocated (includes both live and dead objects).

The `top` command summarizes allocations by function:
```bash
21:56 $ go tool pprof first-visit.prof 

(pprof) top
Showing nodes accounting for 14.33MB, 100% of 14.33MB total
      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
   14.33MB   100%   100%    14.33MB   100%  os.(*File).readdir
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  main.main
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  os.(*File).Readdirnames
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  path/filepath.Walk
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  path/filepath.readDirNames
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  path/filepath.walk
         0     0%   100%    14.33MB   100%  runtime.main
```

`web` opens a graph of memory allocations in a browser:
```bash
(pprof) web
```
![pprof-graph-first-visit](./assets/img/posts/memory-profiling-go-programs/first-visit-graph.png)


What does this show us? Walking the filesystem might seem fairly benign from a memory perspetive, but Go's filepath.Walk provides [lexical ordering guarantees](https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Walk). 

In order to do this, Walk must read the entire directory into memory before proceeding to walk the directory.

We can see from the graph that memory has been allocated within the `os.readdir` call.

> If you want, you can play around with the number of entries in the `demo-dir` walked by the program by modifying the `make-demo-dir.sh` to get an idea of how memory grows with respect to the number of entries in the directory we walk.



Another useful command is: `list <regex>` 

This command shows annotated source for a function matching the provided regex.

We're interested in `os.readdir` here so lets try it:
```bash
(pprof) list readdir
Total: 14.33MB
ROUTINE ======================== os.(*File).readdir in /snap/go/10743/src/os/dir_unix.go
   14.33MB    14.33MB (flat, cum)   100% of Total
         .          .     47:func (f *File) readdir(n int, mode readdirMode) (names []string, dirents []DirEntry, infos []FileInfo, err error) {
         .          .     48:	// If this file has no dirInfo, create one.
         .          .     49:	d := f.dirinfo.Load()
         .          .     50:	if d == nil {
<<<< Redacted for brevity >>>>		 
         .          .    125:		}
         .          .    126:		if n > 0 { // see 'n == 0' comment above
         .          .    127:			n--
         .          .    128:		}
         .          .    129:		if mode == readdirName {
   14.33MB    14.33MB    130:			names = append(names, string(name))
         .          .    131:		} else if mode == readdirDirEntry {
         .          .    132:			de, err := newUnixDirent(f.name, string(name), direntType(rec))
         .          .    133:			if IsNotExist(err) {
         .          .    134:				// File disappeared between readdir and stat.
         .          .    135:				// Treat as if it didn't exist.
```

Pretty helpful huh?! We get this annotation showing us that the `names` slice is where our heap allocations happen in `readdir`:
```bash
   14.33MB    14.33MB    130:			names = append(names, string(name))
```

You can check out the source code for `readdir` [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/os/dir_unix.go#L47) if you'd like to explore more.

Go uses the `names` slice returned from `readdir` to provide the lexical ordering guarantees mentioned earlier.

Lets see a bit of a 'gotcha' now. 

Look at the heap taken during the last file visit:
```bash
go tool pprof last-visit.prof 

(pprof) top
Showing nodes accounting for 24.93MB, 100% of 24.93MB total
      flat  flat%   sum%        cum   cum%
   24.43MB 97.99% 97.99%    24.43MB 97.99%  os.(*File).readdir
    0.50MB  2.01%   100%     0.50MB  2.01%  os.lstatNolog
         0     0%   100%    24.93MB   100%  main.main
         0     0%   100%    24.43MB 97.99%  os.(*File).Readdirnames
         0     0%   100%     0.50MB  2.01%  os.Lstat
         0     0%   100%    24.93MB   100%  path/filepath.Walk
         0     0%   100%    24.43MB 97.99%  path/filepath.readDirNames
         0     0%   100%    24.93MB   100%  path/filepath.walk
         0     0%   100%    24.93MB   100%  runtime.main
```

This seems a little surprising. 

```bash
   24.43MB    24.43MB    130:			names = append(names, string(name))
```

We'd expect that `readdir` should have done all of its allocations before the first file visit, so why the difference?

The answer can be found in `pprof`'s [source docs](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/refs/tags/go1.23.3:src/runtime/pprof/pprof.go;l=119-132):
![pprof-graph-first-visit](./assets/img/posts/memory-profiling-go-programs/pprof-docs.png)


From this we can surmise that the most recent GC when the first heap profile was written must have happened while the call to `readdir` was happening, but before it had allocated all of the entries in the `names` slice.

Given that heap profiles are representative of the most recently completed GC, lets make a small update to our code.

We can use `runtime.GC()` to force a GC before we write our first heap profile:
```go
		// Write heap profile on first visit
		if visitCounter == 0 {
			runtime.GC() // Force a GC before writing a heap profile on the first visit
			err := writeHeap(filepath.Join(outputDir, "first-visit.prof"))
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("Error creating heap during first visit")
				log.Fatal(err)
			}
		}
```

> For good measure, we will also force a GC before writing the last heap profile too, just to prove out that our `readdir` allocations stay 'live' throughout the entire walk:

Lets compare heap profiles after running with these changes:

```

Et voilà! The in-use allocations are equal now. 

On first impressions, it might seem a little odd that runtime.GC() results in an _increase_ in what our heap profile contains on the first file visit.

However, from reading the docs we know that we simply get a more up to date and relevant heap profile by doing so.

So, as a final takeaway, if you care about getting the most recent snapshot possible, take care to call `runtime.GC()` before you write your heap profile!
